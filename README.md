
## Coding will make a new era!

HI, I'm Kaoru.

I usually use CPP as a development language, and I'm also interested in CSharp. 

But actually the first computer language I learned was Java??? 😒

Forget it. Anyway, I love programming. We're gods in the computer world, but we're not.

I believe we can create a better world by coding.

これからも俺たちが立ち止まらないかぎり道は続く！
